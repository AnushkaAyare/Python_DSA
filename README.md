Python Data Structures 
This repository contains my implementation of core data structures built completely from scratch to understand their internal working.
Instead of just using built-in Python structures, I am recreating them to deeply understand memory handling, resizing logic, and internal behavior.

#Implementations So Far

1] Dynamic Array (Custom Python List)
A complete implementation of Python's list built using low-level `ctypes`.
Features implemented:
- Dynamic resizing
- Append, insert, delete, pop, clear
- Indexing, slicing & negative indexing
- Min, max, sum
- Bubble sort
- Merge of two sorted lists
- Magic methods (`__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__str__`, etc.)

Location: `01_Dynamic_Array/mylist.py`

Goal of this Repository
To master Computer Science fundamentals by building everything from scratch instead of only using built-in libraries.

This repo will grow as I implement:
- Linked List
- Stack & Queue
- Trees
- Graphs
- Searching & Sorting algorithms
